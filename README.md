Today, we learned and applied some concepts of libraries of python for machine learning. 
 we use Pandas, matplotlib, Numpy and seaborn and learn how to clean and preprocess  raw data for machine learning
 I use only pandas for the first 3 questions preprocess data and clean data , for the last 2 questions I used all the 4 libraries to normalize/ standardized and then visualize outliers using boxplots and remove them
